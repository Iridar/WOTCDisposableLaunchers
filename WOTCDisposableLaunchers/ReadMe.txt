[WOTC] Disposable Rocket Launchers 2.0

This mod adds three tiers of single-shot Disposable Rocket Launchers (DRLs). They are a heavier alternative to [b]Frag Grenades[/b] - they deal more damage and can be used at longer ranges. 

DRLs can be carried in:[list][*][b]Utility Slot[/b] - any soldier can carry a DRL in a Utility Slot, but this will make them suffer penalties of -1 Mobility and +20% Detection Radius per rocket. These penalties are removed on the next turn after the DRL is fired and disposed of. Utility DRLs cannot be combined with offensive grenades in other slots.
[*][b]Secondary Weapon Slot[/b] - Grenadiers can equip a DRL as a secondary weapon instead of a Grenade Launcher. Obviously, this will make them unable to use Launch Grenade.
[*][b]Heavy Weapon Slot[/b][/list]

Soldiers can carry several DRLs at the same time in different slots.

Conventional DRLs are available from the start of the campaign in infinite quantities. They are then upgraded in [b]Proving Grounds[/b]: [b]Alien Grenade[/b] project will unlock magnetic tier, and [b]Advanced Explosives[/b] project will unlock beam tier.

The mod also adds a few photobooth poses with DRLs.

[h1]COMPANION MODS[/h1]
[list][*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067720616]Improved Rocket Targeting[/url][/b] - highly recommended. Makes rocket targeting more reasonable.
[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2025780967][WOTC] Iridar's Scatter Mod[/url][/b] - if this mod is present, DRLs will have scatter mechanics, making them more balanced relative to grenades.
[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1181681128]Beam Grenade Launcher[/url][/b] - if this mod is present, Beam-tier DRLs will become available after you purchase the Beam Grenade Launcher schematic, which becomes available much later in the campaign than [b]Advanced Explosives[/b] Proving Grounds project. This will make DRLs more balanced.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1533060800][b][WOTC] Open Class Weapon Restrictions[/b][/url] - if this mod is present, all mod-added soldier classes that use a Grenade Launcher secondary weapon will be able to carry a DRL as a secondary weapon.
